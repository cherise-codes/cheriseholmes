	Please tell me I can wrap my palm around our blazing sun
	and pull it from the sky
	so that its fiery tendrils are at my lips 
	then reaching into my throat
	until the entirety of its grandeur is in my core.
	Tell me it will emit golden drops as it twirls on tiptoes
	at the base of my stomach,
	allowing its deep yellow to course through my veins,
	and its heat to rise and rise and 
	carry me away with it.

	Please tell me that if you took your pocketknife, 
	cut down from my collarbones to my bellybutton,
	and unfolded me,
	you would reveal walls painted in sweet lemons and daffodils,
	or perhaps a place where songbirds first learn to sing,
	or maybe just a space to return to &#8211;
	a space to soak your frostbitten fingertips after an ice blue winter. 

	Please tell me that if you pressed your ear to my open mouth,
	you would hear the ocean calling,
	that you would hear the back and forth of frothy waves 
	and the beating wings of seagulls.
	Tell me that salted pearls would roll off my tongue
	to find their way into the not yet yellow parts of your brain,
	to break themselves open and lay their divided halves belly up
	so you can trace the rings,
	trace the timeline that lead to their milky luster.

	Please tell me that when I stand under a streetlamp,
	some of its bright glow seeps into my skin 
	so that when I walk into the night,
	I shine too.

	The field was all green,
	except for you.
	Hushed whispers rustling between leaves,
	violent shushes coming from trees,
	sparrows remaining silent,
	watching the scene unfold before them.
	You stood in the middle of it all,
	rabid flames billowing around you.
	Your engulfed body waiting under a cloud of vultures,
	their tongues twisting at their lips
	as they fly in ravenous circles above your head  &#8211;
	a crown of predators waiting to lock jaws around neck.
	Waves of unforgiving crimson and rusted orange
	lick at your gasoline-soaked flesh,
	eager to burn into bloodstream,
	blaze through neurons,
	smoke and smother pink lungs.
	Black birds swooping down through heat,
	cutting through thick soot and ash,
	and clipping at the meat sliding from your bones.
	Your left hand clutching a lighter,
	steady as fire peels over your palm and wrist,
	blackened thumb still pressing for more fire.
	My throat pulling into itself,
	vocal cords bursting as I scream <i>water,
	       you just need water,</i>
	but your ears are gone
	and the birds are screaming too.
	Your blistering lips curling up at the corners,
	and your eyes soaking in my face,
	and your right hand extending in my direction as if to say
	<i>hold me.</i>
