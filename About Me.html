                            <p> I am a Computer Science major and a Sociology minor pursuing my Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Virginia. My current education and work has been building my expertise in programming languages such as C++, C, Java, HTML, and Python. I have experience interning as a computer science instructor, building network security exercises as an undergraduate teacher's assistant, and developing my own personal projects. My technical interests are complemented by my writing abilities, experience with competitive public speaking, devotion to helping others, and love of the arts. </p>
                        
                        
                        <h2> What others are saying about Cherise </h2>
                        <div class=reviews>
                            <p> "Cherise may appear to be very quiet at first, but my experience has found that she is actively absorbing everything she encounters, weighing it, and then using it to grow and improve as a student, as an actress, and as a person. She has always demonstrated receptiveness to constructive criticism and willingly tries to incorporate suggestions into her performances. <b style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);"> She is open to new approaches and thinking outside of a traditional paradigm. She is extremely versatile in her skill level and has tackled a wide variety of roles.</b> ... Because of her leadership skills, I selected Cherise to serve as the student director for our children's theatre production; as the director, she had full control and responsibility for the crafting of the show including conducting all rehearsals and making all decisions regarding the cast and creative elements of the production. Cherise is highly self-motivated and shows up prepared to work rather than play at rehearsals and she does not tolerate anyone who prevents her from maintaining her focus. She works well with other students and exhibits tremendous patience working with students who easily vex others in the cast. She knows how to be tactful but firm and commands the respect of her peers because she takes her craft very seriously without taking herself too seriously." </p>

                        <p> "She embodies the characteristics of someone who is caring, kind, and works hard to accomplish real change. She is not afraid to speak her mind, and regularly takes on difficult tasks in an attempt to make Kent-Dabney a better home. All the while, Cherise is aware of how her actions affect others, and frequently puts her residents and fellow staffers as her top priority." <br> <br>
                        "Cherise is also a very responsible individual. <b style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);"> In the rare case in which she has made a mistake, she owns it and quickly learns from it.</b>" <br><br>
                        "[She is] a strong communicator. Once she has built a relationship with someone, she is willing to have even the most difficult conversations and undertake the most stressful tasks to attempt to improve a given situation. She is also able to tackle most issues with humor and poise, and picks the proper forum for how to express her thoughts and emotions."

                        "I thoroughly enjoy working alongside Cherise as a dormitory Resident Advisor (RA). She is an energetic go-getter who enjoys designing motivational tools for the residents, initiating a positive environment in the dormitory, and organizing games that are very competitive, yet still encourage camaraderie. Cherise assists the residents through personal and collegiate issues as well as support and celebrate their achievements. The residents look up to her and give Cherise very high ratings which allowed her to be chosen as October's 'RA of the Month'." </p>
                        
                        <p> "During the time that I have known Cherise, it has become apparent to me that <b style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);">she is a good example of a hard worker who is committed academically and professionally as well as having a great commitment to helping others.</b> I am confident that you will be just as impressed with Cherise as I am." </p>
